  position (e.g. "Cross section @ x=23.3"). This is a requested feature for
  CodraFT (<https://pypi.org/project/CodraFT/>).

Bug fixes:

* Fixed ValueError with Levels histogram (occuring when removing an image item
  from plot if histogram has not yet been created)

## Version 2.3.1 ##

Bug fixes:

* Fixed build failures occuring on non-Windows platforms (Issue 54)
* Fixed requirements in README and setup.py: guiqwt v2.3 requires guidata v1.6

## Version 2.3.0 ##

New features:

* Added support for Python 3: a single code source base compatible with both Python 2 and Python 3
* `scaler` C++ extension: added alternative implementations of C99 features so that this extension is now compatible with Microsoft Visual C++ compiler (was only compatible with gcc)
* Replaced all Fortran 77/90 extensions by Cython extensions:
  * Building `guiqwt` no longer requires a Fortran compiler (but only a C/C++ compiler for the C++ scaler extension and the C Cython extensions)
  * 2-D histogram items are drawn 3 times faster than before
  * The Mandelbrot example runs faster too

Bug fixes:

* `guiqwt.image_nanmin/_nanmax`: bug fixed when data is a numpy.ma.MaskedArray object
* `guiqwt.styles`: using copy.deepcopy instead of copy.copy in `ItemParameters.get` to avoid side effects when using more than one instance of a DataSet object
* `guiqwt.annotations`: fixed bug when showing an AnnotatedShape object on an empty plot (unit was None)
* Fixed `PolygonShape` items pickle support (save_items, restore_items)

## Version 2.2.1 ##

New features:

* Added support for plot items serialization/deserialization to/from HDF5:
  * See `save_item`, `load_item`, `save_items` and `load_items` functions in `guiqwt.io`
  * io.save_item/load_item (HDF5): None can be saved/loaded instead of a real item
  * See `serialize` (save to) and `deserialize` (load from) methods in plot objects (save all items) or plot item objects
  * See the new test `loadsaveitems_hdf5.py`
* builder/images: added option 'center_on' to center image data on point of coordinates 'center_on' (tuple)
* Flip/Rotate widget/dialog: added method 'set_parameters' to set default transform parameters
* guiqwt.tools.SignalStatsTool.move: added X range to label
* BaseCurveWidget/BaseImageWidget: added argument `curve_antialiasing` to switch on/off the curve antialiasing feature (this option may be passed to CurveWidget, CurveDialog, ImageWidget or ImageDialog through the `options` dictionary)
* (Issue 29) Added test 'customize_shape_tool.py' to demonstrate how easy it is to customize a shape created with a tool like RectangleTool, EllipseTool, etc.
* (Issue 37) Plot axis widget: added support for mouse double-click to set the axis range

Possible API compatibility issues:

* guiqwt now requires Python 2.6 (Python 2.5 support has been dropped)
* `guiqwt.io` module: file type filters are now sorted depending on data types
  * `iohandler.load_filters` and `iohandler.save_filters` properties have been replaced by a method `iohandler.get_filters`:
    * iohandler.load_filter --> iohandler.get_filters('load')
    * iohandler.save_filter --> iohandler.get_filters('save')
* guidata.hdf5io.HDF5Reader.read: argument 'dataset' was renamed to 'instance'
* MaskedImageItem: masked_areas attribute is now a list of MaskedArea objects (so that MaskedImageItem objects serialization is easier to implement)
* Removed deprecated tools DuplicateCurveTool and DeleteCurveTool

Bug fixes:

* MaskedImageItem/bugfix: fixed rounding error when applying mask to item
* io.imread: drastically reduced loading time with PIL.Image
* RGB images support: fixed vertical orientation issue
* Fixed memory leaks in selection tool, image/curve stats tools and contrast tool
* Curve plot: setting axis scale of both X and Y axes at the same time was not working
* Issue 27: fixed FTBFS on kfreebsd due to Werror flag (patch from Frédéric Picca)
* FreeFormTool/MultiLineTool: fixed warning when clicking the first two points if these two points are at the exact same position (happened only when creating such a shape on an empty canvas)
* Fixed "Edit data..." tool: `oedit` function returns None when dialog is canceled or an array when it's validated (fixed "truth value" error)
* (Issue 32) pyplot/better compatibility with Matplotlib: `plot` now accepts lists instead of NumPy arrays
* (Issue 33) tools.LoadItemsTool: parent constructor was not called
* (Issue 36) plot.PlotManager: fixed typo when setting the plot manager to `plot_id`

## Version 2.2.0 ##

New features:

* Added scaler module: resize function (using scaler C++ engine to resize images) which is incredibly faster than scipy.misc.imresize
* `guiqwt.io` module was rewritten: new extensible I/O functions `imwrite`/`imread` (see section 'Possible API compatibility issues')
* SelectTool:
  * added Undo/Redo actions (triggered by platform's standard key sequences)
  * "Select all" action is now triggered by platform's standard key sequence
* Added 'get_segment' test (analog to 'get_point')
* Interactive tools: added argument 'switch_to_default_tool' (if True, when tool action is finished, plot manager will automatically switch to the default tool)
* Added `label.RangeInfo` object: showing XRangeSelection shape informations (x, dx) in a label. See associated method 'range_info_label' in 'builder.make' singleton and unit test in 'tests/computations.py'.
* Snapshot tool: added an option to apply (or not) the interpolation algorithm
* `guiqwt.pyplot`: selecting default item type, hence allowing to use directly tools when there is only one curve/image without having to select it before
* Added new guiqwt svg logo
* Added new dialogs and widgets for manipulating (multiple) images:
  * Rotate&Crop dialog, widget and tool (+ test) for TrImageItem plot items
  * Flip&Rotate dialog and widget
* `pyplot.imshow`: added interpolation option ('nearest', 'linear', 'antialiasing')
* `io.imagefile_to_array`: added support for 16-bit Tiff with PhotoInterpretation=1
* ResizeDialog: added option "keep original size" to bypass this dialog
* RectangularActionTool: added option 'fix_orientation' (default: False, but set to True for the SnapshotTool)

Possible API compatibility issues:

* `guiqwt.io` module was rewritten -- potential API breaks:
  * `imagefile_to_array` --> `imread`
  * `array_to_imagefile` --> `imwrite`
  * `array_to_dicomfile` --> `imwrite`
  * `IMAGE_LOAD_FILTERS` --> `iohandler.load_filters`
  * `IMAGE_SAVE_FILTERS` --> `iohandler.save_filters`
  * `set_dynamic_range_from_dtype` --> `scale_data_to_dtype`

* Created `guiqwt.widgets` package to regroup ResizeDialog and RotateCropDialog/Widget
* Moved module `guiqwt.fit` to `guiqwt.widgets` package

Bug fixes:

* `guiqwt.geometry` : fixed zero division error in `compute_angle` function
* Fixed minimum value for histogram display
* Fixed Issue 16: use double precision for point baseclass
* Fixed rounding error in image.assemble_imageitems: concerns the snapshot tool, and the new rotate/crop dialog box (Rotate/Crop dialog: added a specific test checking if exported image is exactly identical to the original image when the cropping rectangle has the same size and position as the image below -- see rotatecrop.py test script).
* scaler: linear interpolation was inactive on image edges (first/last col/row)
* ImagePlot widget: fixed aspect ratio when showing the widget for the first time
* Events/Hit test:
  * Plot item: fixed AttributeError with cursors (when clicking on the canvas with no current active item)
  * Curve item: avoid showing dividing by zero warning
* tools.SnapshotTool:
  * now fixing ROI orientation to avoid the negative size issue
  * now handling out of memory errors for big images

## Version 2.1.6 ##

Other changes:

  * added support for all image types supported by Qt (JPEG, TIFF, PNG, ...)
  * first argument (`fname`) may now be a file-like object (e.g. StringIO)
* guiqwt.baseplot/curve: added stepsize in `set_axis_limits` and removed from `set_axis_ticks`
* guiqwt.image:
  * QuadGridItem: allow set_data to update X,Y along with Z
  * new item PolygonMapItem: PolygonMapItem is intended to display maps i.e. items containing several hundreds of independent polygons
* guiqwt.builder.make.error: added options 'errorbarwidth', 'errorbarcap', 'errorbarmode' and 'errorbaralpha' (avoid having to tweak the ErrorBarParam to customize these settings)
* guiqwt.pyplot/pydicom: avoid the annoying warning message about the DICOM dictionnary revert
* guiqwt.tools:
  * EditItemDataTool: new tool for editing displayed curve/image data using a GUI-based array editor (this feature requires the `spyderlib` library)

Bug fixes:

* ErrorBarCurveItem (error bar curves):
  * now handling NaNs uncertainties properly
  * handling runtime warnings that could end badly in draw method (example: transforming a zero in log scale)
* Annotations/pickle bugfix: a QString (instead of unicode) was pickled for annotation title, hence leading to compatiblity issues with PyQt API v2
* guiqwt.io.array_to_dicomfile: fixed value representation error for smallest/largest pixel value parameters
* guiqwt.resizedialog.is_edit_valid: fixed compatibility issue with PyQt API v2

* geometry.colvector: fixed major regression in coordinates calculations (significative impact on TrImageItem related features)

## Version 2.1.5 ##

Other changes:

* guiqwt.io: added function 'eliminate_outliers' to cut image levels histogram (previously available only for display)
* baseplot: added method 'copy_to_clipboard' + tools: added CopyToClipboardTool (copy canevas window to clipboard)

## Version 2.1.4 ##

Since this version, `guiqwt` is compatible with PyQt4 API #1 *and* API #2.
Please read carefully the coding guidelines which have been recently added to
the documentation.

Bug fixes:

* Sift/bugfix: difference/division operations were performed backwards (s001-s000 instead of s000-s001)
* Sift: working directory is now changed after opening/saving signal/image
* label.RangeComputation: fixed bug if compute function was returning more than one result and when X-range was empty (e.g. selection is outside curve X-axis values)
* curve.CurvePlot: fixed pan/zoom erratic behavior for curves associated with log-scale axes
* baseplot.BasePlot: now performing an autoscale after changing axis lin/log scale (set_axis_scale/set_scales)
* annotations.AnnotatedSegment/CRITICAL: fixed an error (introduced in v2.1.0) when computing segment length (returned length was twice lower than the real value)
* image.XYImageItem (Contributor: Carlos Pascual): fixed bug when Y-axis array is of dimension Ni+1 (where Ni is the number of rows of the image pixel data array)
* Fixed compatiblity issues with PyQt v4.4 (Contributor: Carlos Pascual)
* (minor) Fixed label text (too long) of 2D-Histogram items background color in shown DataSet
* guiqwt.io.array_to_dicomfile/bugfix: Smallest/LargestImagePixelValue fields had wrong type (str instead of int)
* LabelTool: label was not moved as expected (default: now, label is *not* attached to canvas)
* tools.ImageStatsTool/bugfix: image title was not shown
* CurvePlot: autoscale for log scales / bugfix: handling zero values
* tools.AxisScaleTool/bugfix: when updating its status, the tool was setting the axes scales even when not necessary, hence causing an autoscale since changeset 1159 (687e22074f8d)
* ItemCenterTool was not working as expected when centering annotated shapes having a specific transform matrix
* XYImageItem objects: re-added cross-section support (removed accidently)
* Curve autoscale method (curve.CurvePlot/ErrorBarCurvePlot):
  * now handles non-finite values (NaNs and infs)
  * logarithmic scales: now excludes zero/negative values to avoid confusing the autoscale algorithm

Possible API compatibility issues:

* Moved functions from guiqwt.io to new module guiqwt.qthelpers: exec_image_save_dialog, exec_image_open_dialog, exec_images_open_dialog
* Markers:
  * label and constraint callbacks take now 2 arguments (the marker's coordinates) instead of 3
  * removed method 'move_point_to': use new method 'set_pos' instead (takes two arguments: x, y)
* Removed cursors introduced in v2.1.0:
  * These cursors have been replaced by shapes.Marker (i.e. objects derived from QwtPlotMarker)
  * Removed signals.SIG_CURSOR_MOVED, shapes.HorizontalCursor, shapes.VerticalCursor, annotations.AnnotatedHCursor, annotations.AnnotatedVCursor and associated builder methods (annotated_vcursor, annotated_hcursor)
  * Builder methods vcursor and hcursor were slightly changed (see tests/cursors.py to adapt your code)
  * Use markers instead of cursors (and SIG_MARKER_CHANGED instead of SIG_CURSOR_MOVED -- arguments are not identical, see signals.py):
    * base object: shapes.Marker
    * associated builder methods: marker, vcursor, hcursor, xcursor (see tests/cursors.py)
* label.LabelItem: renamed method 'set_position' to 'set_pos' (consistency with shapes.PointShape, ...)
* Annotations:
  * method `get_center` now returns coordinates *without* applying the transform matrix, i.e. in pure plot coordinates
  * the following methods were renamed to highlight the fact that the transform matrix is applied in those computations:
    * `get_center` was renamed to `get_tr_center`
    * `get_size` was renamed to `get_tr_size`
    * `get_angle` was renamed to `get_tr_angle`
    * `get_diameter` was renamed to `get_tr_diameter`
    * `get_length` was renamed to `get_tr_length`
* Removed the following deprecated classes in `guiqwt.plot`:
  * CurvePlotWidget (renamed to CurveWidget)
  * CurvePlotDialog (renamed to CurveDialog)
  * ImagePlotWidget (renamed to ImageWidget)
  * ImagePlotDialog (renamed to ImageDialog)

Other changes:

* Added module qthelpers: image open/save dialog helpers (moved from guiqwt.io to avoid using GUIs in this module)

* Sift: added linear calibration (signals: X/Y axes, images: Z axis)
* Interactive tools: added signal SIG_TOOL_JOB_FINISHED emitted when tool has finished its job + if SWITCH_TO_DEFAULT_TOOL class attribute is True, switching to the default interactive tool
* Buider: added cross cursor and marker constructors (builder.make.marker and builder.make.xcursor, see tests/cursors.py)
* Added SignalStatsTool (standard curve tool) to show ymin, ymax, ymean, ... on a selected curve ROI
* Sift: added support for curve data with error bars (I/O + operations + processing)
* Added coding guidelines to the documentation
* builder/make.computation/computation2d: added title option (defaults to object's (curve or image) label)
* plot.CurvePlot, plot.CurveWidget: added keyword arguments 'xunit' and 'yunit' to set axes units (same syntax as labels)
* plot.ImagePlot, plot.ImageWidget: added keyword arguments 'xunit', 'yunit' and 'zunit' to set axes units (same syntax as labels)

## Version 2.1.3 ##

Bug fixes:

* tools.RectangularActionTool: removed unnecessary calls to setup_shape_appearance
* tools.ImageStatsTool/CrossSectionTool.setup_shape / bugfix: parent method was not called
* Sift/bugfix: Spyder's internal shell was not parented -- this was causing issues with spyderlib v2.0.11
* Cross section/auto refresh toggle button: do not refresh plot if disabling the auto refresh mode
* (Fixes Issue 14) tools.CommandTool: docstring was translated from french
* (Fixes Issue 13) Fixed precision/string formatting issue: switched from '%f' to '%g' (on-curve labels, ...)

* Cross section panel: when a cross section shape has been removed, clearing cross section curve before removing it (notify other panels)
* Cross sections/update_plot: added option 'refresh' (default: True) --> we do not want to refresh the cross section panel systematically after registering a new shape
* Annotations/annotationparam: added 'readonly' and 'private' options (bugfix: these parameters are now pickled correctly for shapes)

## Version 2.1.2 ##

* TrImageParam: fixed wrong class inheritance
* LegendBoxItem/bugfix: missing argument for include_item
* guiqwt.image.get_filename: bugfix when filename is None

* guiqwt.label/bugfix: text label was reset to '' when redrawn
* guiqwt.fit: bugfixes when using logscale
* guiqwt.io.array_to_imagefile/text files: format is now '%d' for integer data types
* (Fixes Issue 7) guifit: standard fit boundary excludes rightmost value
* guiqwt/curve.py: added workaround to avoid division by zero when clicking between curves
* guiqwt/io.py-array_to_dicomfile: fixed ambiguous VR for PixelData when changing DICOM data (forced to 'OB')
* Bugfix: recent versions of PyQt don't like the QApplication reference to be stored in modules (why is that?)
* Annotation/get_infos: fixed unicode error occuring with py2exe distribution only

Possible API compatibility issues:

* Panel interface: added mandatory method 'configure_panel' which is called just before adding the very first tool to the manager
* baseplot: renamed guiqwt.baseplot.EnhancedQwtPlot to BasePlot
