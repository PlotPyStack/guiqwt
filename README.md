## Overview

Based on ``PythonQwt`` (a pure Python/PyQt reimplementation of the curve
plotting Qwt C++ library, included in guiqwt base source code) and on the
scientific modules NumPy and SciPy, ``guiqwt`` is a Python library providing
efficient 2D data-plotting features (curve/image visualization and related
tools) for interactive computing and signal/image processing application
development. It is based on Qt graphical user interfaces library, and
currently supports both ``PyQt5`` and ``PySide2``.

Extension to ``PythonQwt``:

* set of tools for curve and image plotting
* GUI-based application development helpers
