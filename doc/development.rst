Coding guidelines
-----------------

In general, we try to follow the standard Python coding guidelines, which cover
all the important coding aspects (docstrings, comments, naming conventions,
import statements, ...) as described here:

* `Style Guide for Python Code  <http://www.python.org/peps/pep-0008.html>`_

The easiest way to check that your code is following those guidelines is to
run `pylint` (a note greater than 9/10 seems to be a reasonnable goal).
