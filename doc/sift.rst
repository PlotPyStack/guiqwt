Sift, the Signal and Image Filtering Tool
=========================================

`Sift` is a simple signal and image processing application based on ``guiqwt``
and ``guidata``.

Note that `Sift` includes an embedded Python console to manipulate directly
the signal and image objects (see screenshot below).

Even if it could be extended with powerful features like its closed-source
counterpart, `Sift` is quite limited in its current implementation. For now,
its main purpose is to show how to create easily and rapidly your own
signal/image processing application using ``guidata`` and ``guiqwt``.
